# Wifi-Bluetooth-Scanner🛰️ WiFi-Bluetooth Scanner
📖 Description

The WiFi-Bluetooth Scanner is a cross-platform utility tool designed to scan, identify, and display nearby Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth devices in real time. This project provides a clean and intuitive interface for network and device discovery, making it an ideal solution for developers, network administrators, and enthusiasts who want to analyze signal strengths, security types, and connection parameters.

The scanner leverages system APIs and libraries (such as socket, scapy, bluetooth, and wifi in Python or equivalent frameworks in other languages) to fetch detailed information about available wireless and Bluetooth devices. Users can view essential parameters like SSID, BSSID, Signal Strength (RSSI), Encryption Type, Channel Frequency, and for Bluetooth devices — Device Name, MAC Address, Signal Strength, and Device Type.

A key focus of the project is real-time data visualization. The tool can continuously refresh device lists, allowing users to monitor changes dynamically as devices connect or disconnect. Additionally, logs can be exported in JSON or CSV format for further analysis or auditing purposes.
